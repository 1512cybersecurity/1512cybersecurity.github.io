<h1>EFFECT OF CYBERSECURITY ON SOCIETY AND INDIVIDUALS</h1>


</ul><h5><p>Cybersecurity is the art of protecting computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from unauthorised access or criminal use and the practice of criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. It is basically protecting every part of the computer and the internet from communication, entertainment, transportation, shopping, medicine, and more. As we rely on technology and care about our personal information stored in computers, smartphones, and tablets, cybersecurity needs to be everywhere to protect our information from the risks.
<p></h5>
<h5><p>We chose to research this topic as cybersecurity since computer networks and information technology solutions are becoming incredibly important in today’s world. As our reliance on information in technology continues to grow, cyber attacks are becoming more appealing and potentially more disastrous. Therefore we thought that cybersecurity is important because it protects against cyber attacks as not only nations and businesses face threats from the actions and intentions of hackers, but individuals face many risks as well.
<p></h5>
<h5><p>Cybersecurity is important as the technology is building up really fast nowadays as cyber attacks occur every 14 seconds. Cyberattacks are basically affected to every person in the global world which are really common attacks, which is really dangerous. The fast changes in technology will cause more cyberattacks. For example the latest network service, 5G creates a greatly expanded, multidimensional cyberattack vulnerability. Cyberattack is critically damaged to businesses and people lose jobs. There has been an influx of hacks and breaches of name brand companies in recent years. It costs a lot of money to recover the data and penalties paid through fines. For example Facebook, the social media had over $540 million user records exposed to Amazon’s cloud computing service. The most dangerous and impact will be the cybersecurity threats faced by individuals. Not only do nations and businesses face threats from the actions and intentions of hackers, but individuals face many risks as well. Identity thief is a huge issue, where hackers steal an individual’s personal information and sell it for profit. This also puts the personal safety of an individual and family at risk as well. This happened on numerous occasions and millions of dollars were lost at the expense of the victim.
</p></h5>
<h5><p>There are five common types of cybersecurity which are cloud security, network security, application security, internet of things (IoT) security, and critical infrastructure security.
</p></h5>
<h5><p>Cloud security is a cloud-based data storage that became a popular option over the last decade due to its enhanced privacy. It still needs software that protects from the threats and alerts you if anything suspicious happens with your cloud accounts. Network security is basically securing the network against outside threats. Application security is to protect the data you store on the applications. Since applications are more accessible over various networks, they are especially open to cyberattacks. IoT refers to a wide variety of critical and non-critical cyber physical systems like appliances, sensors, televisions, wifi and printers. The critical infrastructure security is deployed to secure the systems that have the critical infrastructure. These include the electricity grid, traffic lights and hospitals.
