<h1>EFFECT OF CYBERSECURITY ON SOCIETY AND INDIVIDUALS</h1>


</ul><h5><p>Cybersecurity is the art of protecting computers, servers, mobile devices, electronic systems, networks, and data from unauthorised access or criminal use and the practice of criminal use and the practice of ensuring confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. It is basically protecting every part of the computer and the internet from communication, entertainment, transportation, shopping, medicine, and more. As we rely on technology and care about our personal information stored in computers, smartphones, and tablets, cybersecurity needs to be everywhere to protect our information from the risks.
<p></h5>
<h5><p>We chose to research this topic as cybersecurity since computer networks and information technology solutions are becoming incredibly important in todayâ€™s world. As our reliance on information in technology continues to grow, cyber attacks are becoming more appealing and potentially more disastrous. Therefore we thought that cybersecurity is important because it protects against cyber attacks as not only nations and businesses face threats from the actions and intentions of hackers, but individuals face many risks as well.
