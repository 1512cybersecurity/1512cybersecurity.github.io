<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>
	
<h4><em>Multiple ethical issues are to be considered when dealing with cyber security. As the knowledge of cyber security measures are more and more easily acquired, the methods of exploiting vulnerabilities through cyber attacks can be easily learnt through a little research online as well. This side effect leads to an ethical problem where teaching cyber security can lead to hackers. But, I think that good (cybersecurity) only exists if evil (cyber attacks) are present. The mass amount of hackers that are constantly providing threat to businesses and members of society are the only reason that cyber security specialists are needed. If hackers were to suddenly stop hacking, many jobs will become redundant and result in job loss,  homelessness and poverty. Throughout researching on this topic, I have come to an understanding that there are many bad people that choose to hack, that create risks for companies and society. However, these hackers also bring in opportunities and choices for people. Cyber attacks give a chance for anyone to educate themselves to not only protect oneself, but potentially get a job that protects others from these cyber attacks. In my opinion, there are always going to be people that choose to cause harm to others, to cheat the system for their own personal gain. However, I believe as long as we live in a stable society, good will always overcome evil. I think that having information regarding cyber security to be easily accessible is important for society to progress. The world needs to continuously learn to progress, this means taking risks. The upside of teaching cybersecurity heavily outweighs the negatives. In my personal experience, I have been tempted to join the dark side and commit cyber attacks. But I have found the light, the opportunity to go to university and graduate with a major in cyber security. I recommend others to find the light and educate themselves on cyber security.</em></h4><br>
