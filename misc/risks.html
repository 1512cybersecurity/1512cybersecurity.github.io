<h1>Technology Risks</h1>


</ul><h4><p>Cyber attacks are evolving every day and we must know how to protect ourselves from these attacks. These risks need to be looked out for to protect companies and individuals from cyber attacks. Without appropriate or reliable cybersecurity practices, a number of vulnerabilities are exposed to cyber attacks. 
Some of the cyber attacks are:<p>

Denial-of-service attack which overloads systems, servers, or networks with traffic. This results in people not being able to access the affected website. Attacks using multiple devices are known as a distributed-denial-of-service (DDoS) attack. DDoS assaults are carried out via networks of machines that are linked to the Internet. These networks are made up of malware-infected PCs and other devices that can be manipulated remotely by an attacker. Individual devices are known as bots, while a botnet is a collection of bots. After establishing a botnet, an attacker can lead an attack by delivering remote commands to each bot.When the botnet targets a victim's server or network, each bot sends requests to the target's IP address, possibly overloading the server or network and producing a denial-of-service attack. An example of a major DDoS attack was in 2020 where Amazon Web Services were targeted by hackers. Amazon is a massive company that is used worldwide. This DDoS attack lasted for three days and led to revenue losses and a damaged reputation for Amazon. <p>
 
 
Phishing is the act of sending fraudulent communications that appear to come from a reputable source. An example is when you get a link to a fake website pretending to be Google which requires you to “login” by entering your details. Because the fraudster is imitating a reputable organisation or person, phishing attempts frequently appear or sound real. They might be impersonating your bank, the government, etc. Scammers that use phishing attacks may get you to submit information, take a survey, pay a fee, or make another request that will allow them access to your personal data. Phishing is extremely dangerous and victims of this type of cyber attack will be severely affected. Phishing leads to sensitive data like credit card and login information being stolen, or malware being installed in the victim’s device. This can result in major financial loss and potential mental health problems for victims as being scammed is very traumatic and could lead to trust issues.<p>
Malware is a term used to describe malicious software, anything like spyware, ransomware, viruses, and worms. Once inside the system, malware can block the user from accessing their files (ransomware), secretly steal sensitive information (spyware), perform other malicious actions that make the computer unusable. Malware is the most common type of attack that cyber criminals use, either by exploiting existing vulnerabilities or by utilising unique qualities of developing technology. Malware is very dangerous for both companies and individuals. Malware can result in very important data being destroyed or manipulated which can lead to people not being able to work and make a living. Having an infected computer with malware is also very stressful and harmful to our mental well being. <p>
