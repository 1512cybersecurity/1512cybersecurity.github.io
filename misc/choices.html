<h1>Cyber Security Choices</h1>


</ul><h4><p>1.software development security<p>
	<p><p>
	<p>Security, as part of the software development process, is an ongoing process involving people and practices, and ensures application confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Secure software is the result of security aware software development processes where security is built in and thus software is developed with security in mind. Security is most effective if planned and managed through.<p>
	<p><p>
	<p>Testing for security<p>
	<p><p>
	<p>Authentication, authorization, confidentiality, availability, integrity, non-repudiation, and resilience are all common security testing attributes. Security testing is necessary to ensure that unauthorized users do not gain access to the system's resources or data. Some application data is transmitted via the internet, passing through a succession of servers and network devices.<p>
	<p><p>
	<p>Network security<p>
	<p><p>
	<p>Network security refers to the policies, processes, and practices that are put in place to prevent, detect, and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and its resources. Network security entails the authorization of data access in a network, which is managed by the network administrator. Users select or are assigned an ID and password, or other authentication information, which grants them access to information and programs under their authority.<p>
	<p><p>
	<p>Data security<p>
	<p>Data security entails protecting digital data, such as those in a database, against destructive forces and the unwanted actions of unauthorized users, such as a cyberattack or a data breach.<p>
