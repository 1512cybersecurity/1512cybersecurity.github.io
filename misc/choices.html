<h1>Cyber Security Choices</h1>


</ul><h4><p>Software development security</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Security, as part of the software development process, is an ongoing process involving people and practices, and ensures application confidentiality, integrity, and availability. Secure software is the result of security aware software development processes where security is built in and thus software is developed with security in mind. Security is most effective if planned and managed through. A security software developer is a new type of technologist that creates computer programs with the goal of protecting computer systems and data. A security software engineer is someone who can work well in a team and communicate effectively both in writing and verbally. At the same time, they understand how to create and deploy security-oriented computer programs. Working directly with a software development team to provide specifications, testing, and design of software components to make them as secure as possible is common in security software development. Communication with a team of developers, designers, and engineers is essential to ensuring that potential threats are anticipated and properly mitigated.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Testing for security</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Authentication, authorization, confidentiality, availability, integrity, non-repudiation, and resilience are all common security testing attributes. Security testing is necessary to ensure that unauthorized users do not gain access to the system's resources or data. Some application data is transmitted via the internet, passing through a succession of servers and network devices.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Network security</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Network security refers to the policies, processes, and practices that are put in place to prevent, detect, and monitor unauthorized access, misuse, modification, or denial of a computer network and its resources. Network security entails the authorization of data access in a network, which is managed by the network administrator. Users select or are assigned an ID and password, or other authentication information, which grants them access to information and programs under their authority. In a nutshell, it is a set of rules and configurations designed to protect the integrity, confidentiality, and accessibility of computer networks and data using both software and hardware technologies. Every organization, regardless of size, industry, or infrastructure, requires network security solutions to protect it from the ever-changing landscape of cyber threats in the wild today. Today's network architecture is complex, with a constantly changing threat environment and attackers constantly looking for and exploiting vulnerabilities. These flaws can exist in a variety of contexts, including devices, data, applications, users, and locations.

	<p>Data security</p>
	<p>Data security entails protecting digital data, such as those in a database, against destructive forces and the unwanted actions of unauthorized users, such as a cyberattack or a data breach. When properly implemented, robust data security strategies protect an organization's information assets not only from cybercriminal activities, but also from insider threats and human error, which continue to be among the leading causes of data breaches today. Data security entails deploying tools and technologies that improve an organization's visibility into where its critical data is stored and how it is used. Ideally, these tools should be able to apply safeguards such as encryption, data masking, and sensitive file redaction, as well as automate reporting to streamline audits and ensure compliance with regulatory requirements. Working with hardware-based security: A hardware device allows a user to manually log in, log out, and set different levels. To prevent malicious users from logging in, logging out, and changing privilege levels, the device employs biometric technology. Controllers in peripheral devices such as hard discs read the current state of a device's user. Illegal access to data by a malicious user or a malicious program is prevented by hard disc based on the current state of the user, making illegal access to data impossible. Because operating systems are vulnerable to malicious attacks by viruses and hackers, hardware-based access control is more secure than software-based access control. After a malicious access is obtained, the data on hard discs can be corrupted. Software cannot manipulate user privilege levels when using hardware-based protection. A hacker or malicious program will never be able to gain access to secure data protected by hardware or perform unauthorized privileged operations. Only if the hardware is malicious or contains a backdoor is this assumption violated. The hardware prevents tampering with the operating system image and file system privileges. As a result, using a combination of hardware-based security and secure system administration policies, a completely secure system can be created.
