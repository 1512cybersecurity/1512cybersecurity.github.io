<h1>Cyber Security Choices</h1>


</ul><h4><p>comp 501


Here is some Choices for cyber security.


First one is software development security. 

Software development security includes software security testing, development process security and source code security. 
These security measures are mainly used to ensure that information will not be leaked or stolen during the process of generation, transmission, and storage.


next one is network security 

Anti-ddos is a type of network security. Anti-DDoS monitors the traffic of Internet access to the public network IP in real time to detect DDoS attack，

Network security also includes cloud security and network isolation.



last one is data security 

Data security can be broken down into data leakage prevention, data backup and recovery,


Next we have our team roles

We are all doing the research 
Eitik is our project manager
Jayden is our Editor
