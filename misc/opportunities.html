<h1>Technology Opportunities</h1>


</ul><h4><p>Having actually good cybersecurity practices is essential for businesses and organisations to protect the individuals from various cyber attacks. A number of opportunities specifically are present for cyber security specialists in businesses. Organisations must have good measures for preventing cyber attacks to ensure <p>
Data Security - making fairly sure that sensitive information does not get manipulated or leaked by intruders. This is especially important for organisations and companies to particularly follow and implement as the company’s data and the user’s data can basically contain very sensitive information. If sensitive information gets leaked, many people’s lives and livelihoods are at risk in a big way. An example kind of happened with the Japanese video game company Capcom, which is fairly significant. In November 2020, Capcom fell victim to a ransomware attack which led to a data breach. According to Capcom, up to 350,000 people specifically have basically personal information leaked. The victims ranged from customers, to shareholders, and to employees. This data breach also kind of resulted in a $12m lawsuit being filed as Capcom definitely were found to have stolen photos from a designer in some of their games. This could significantly impact hundreds and thousands of people if the company were to lose that massive amount of money. Having inadequate data security also resulted in serious delays which affects the business to actually run efficiently. <p>
Efficiency - keep businesses running without any disruptions. Efficiency is especially important when running companies. As previously mentioned, Capcom essentially suffered a cyber attack which led to data being destroyed and leaked. This attack majorly hurts the efficiency of the company. With really poor efficiency comes delays, which leads to wasted money, employees being overworked, and not meeting the customers demands or needs. Time is money, and having really constant delays will significantly hurt the profits needed for a company to thrive. Employees need to get paid and with delays due to poor cyber security practices will lead to employees working more hours than they are supposed to. The combined additional work hours and drop in profit can lead to a company to go under which for all intents and purposes affects hundreds and thousands of people, from employees, to customers, to shareholders.  <p>
A positive reputation in society - earn trust from the public. Having a positive reputation actually is essential for businesses and organisations alike. If the public doesn’t trust or doesn’t like a company, that company could actually lose customers and money in a major way. A poor public perception could lead to the company going bankrupt which is actually bad for it’s employees and shareholders. Having a poor reputation also can result in people not wanting to work for the company or people quitting from the company. This results in the decline of a business which leads to failure and closure. <p>
Having a capable cyber security system within a business is a must for running a successful company. Without adequate cyber security practices will definitely lead to failed businesses and hurt individuals in our society.<p>
