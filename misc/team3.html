<h2>Ethical issues relating to the technology, your personal reflections and recommendations </h2>
	<p></p>
	<p>Regarding ethical issues, the first thing I think of is data security. According to my existing knowledge, data security is to protect data from accidental leakage, loss, or malicious theft during the process of access, transmission and storage. I think most of the ethical issues of data security are about privacy. In today's society, everyone generates a lot of data every day. This data may be a newly bought mechanical keyboard shared on Facebook or a search on Google about headaches. These data, like the user's footprint, provide huge benefits to those advertisers. They use a large amount of fragmented data to analyze user behavior, and the result of the analysis is a prediction of the user's future behavior. Such predictions make the delivery of advertisements more accurate and efficient, and will only be delivered to users with a very high probability of purchase. This makes me very panic, because it means that whatever you do will always leave a trace, but I am a person who often cannot restrain my impulsive consumption, so these problems bother me very much.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Another question is whether major technology companies pay enough attention to data security. In 2014, Apple's iCloud was attacked, and a large number of nude photos of celebrities were leaked. There are many absurd things like this, but there is no answer to this question about hacking, because what makes technology progress is the struggle between people. So, can we question these technology companies? They have a large amount of high-quality user data. Have they benefited from this private data? I think everyone has a different opinion on this issue. I think it must exist, and the value of data will become greater and greater in the future.</p>
	<p></p>
	<p>Cyber security is a very general concept. It was born at the same time as the Internet and developed along with the development of the Internet. As long as humans have desires, this concept will not disappear.</p>
